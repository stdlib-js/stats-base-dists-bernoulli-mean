    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

## Installation

```bash
npm install @stdlib/stats-base-dists-bernoulli-mean
```

Alternatively,

-   To load the package in a website via a `script` tag without installation and bundlers, use the [ES Module][es-module] available on the [`esm` branch][esm-url].
-   If you are using Deno, visit the [`deno` branch][deno-url].
-   For use in Observable, or in browser/node environments, use the [Universal Module Definition (UMD)][umd] build available on the [`umd` branch][umd-url].

The [branches.md][branches-url] file summarizes the available branches and displays a diagram illustrating their relationships.

</section>

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var mean = require( '@stdlib/stats-base-dists-bernoulli-mean' );
```

#### mean( p )

Returns the [expected value][expected-value] of a [Bernoulli][bernoulli-distribution] distribution with success probability `p`.

```javascript
var v = mean( 0.1 );
// returns 0.1

v = mean( 0.5 );
// returns 0.5
```

If provided a success probability `p` outside of `[0,1]`, the function returns `NaN`.

```javascript
var v = mean( NaN );
// returns NaN

v = mean( 1.5 );
// returns NaN

v = mean( -1.0 );
// returns NaN
```
