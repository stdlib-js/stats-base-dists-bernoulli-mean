    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
import mean from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/stats-base-dists-bernoulli-mean@esm/index.mjs';
```
The previous example will load the latest bundled code from the esm branch. Alternatively, you may load a specific version by loading the file from one of the [tagged bundles](https://github.com/stdlib-js/stats-base-dists-bernoulli-mean/tags). For example,

```javascript
import mean from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/stats-base-dists-bernoulli-mean@v0.3.1-esm/index.mjs';
```

#### mean( p )

Returns the [expected value][expected-value] of a [Bernoulli][bernoulli-distribution] distribution with success probability `p`.

```javascript
var v = mean( 0.1 );
// returns 0.1

v = mean( 0.5 );
// returns 0.5
```

If provided a success probability `p` outside of `[0,1]`, the function returns `NaN`.

```javascript
var v = mean( NaN );
// returns NaN

v = mean( 1.5 );
// returns NaN

v = mean( -1.0 );
// returns NaN
```
